		<h1>Semester 6 Project: Elevator CAN Design</h1>
		<p>Welcome to the information page for <b>Semester 6 Project</b>.<br/>
		On this page you will find the overview of the project and the planning that goes along with it.</p>

		<h2>Purpose</h2>
		<p>To create an elevator that demonstrates the usage of CAN for communication between nodes on seperate floors, elevator node and also a connection with a logic node.
		See the flow diagram of how the system is connected or see below.

		<h3>Mike Lynn-Davis</h3>
			<ul>
			<li>Configuration of database used by the state machine
			<li>Setting up PCAN to communicated with the CAN network
			<li>Assisting in the creating of a user GUI for elevator control
			<li>Assisting with the CAN node setup for all nodes
			</ul>
		<h3>Shiv Sandhu</h3>
			<ul>
			<li>Creating a Webpage for the project with integration to LogBooks and other project needs (<b>This one!</b>)
			<li>Creating the flow diagram for the CAN system
			<li>Designing and implimenting the push buttons and LEDs connected to each floor and elevator
			<li>Reading the position sensor to determine which floor the elevator is on, and displaying on 7-segment display
			<li>Translating the button press to LED on/off
			<li>Translating the button press to a bit being sent out for CAN protocol configutaion
			</ul>
		<h3>Arish G</h3>
